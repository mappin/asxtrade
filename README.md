 ## System Requirements

  * Python 3.8

  * Django

  * Djongo (python MongoDB for Django apps)

  * Other requirements documented in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)


## Installation

### Pre-requisite software installation

On the system to run the website, you'll need to install required software:
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/ozacas/asxtrade.git
cd asxtrade
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd src/viewer # for setting up the website
~~~~

### Setup MongoDB database server

Next, you'll want to setup a database to store the ASX data: instructions for this can be found at the [MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

### Setup the website and superuser for administrating the site

~~~~
python3 manage.py migrate

python3 manage.py createsuperuser

python3 manage.py runserver # run on local dev. host
~~~~

### Installing data

  You can run `python3 src/asxtrade.py --want-prices` to fetch daily data. This application only works with daily data fetched after 4pm each trading day from the ASX website. It will take several hours per run.

  Existing data ready to import into mongodb v4.4 can be fetched from [github large file storage](https://github.com/ozacas/asxtrade/raw/master/data/asxtrade.20210306.bson.gz) using [mongorestore](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/mongorestore/). This data covers the daily data from July 2020 thru March 2021, although ETF data covers a smaller period due to missing code.

## Testing

Tox is used to drive pytest to execute the unit test. Django `manage.py test` is not used. Github Actions is then used to invoke tox for CI/CD for the application and unit tests.

HTML unit test coverage reports can be produced using something like (from the root of the local repo):

~~~~
$ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src/viewer
$ pytest -c pytest.ini --cov-report html --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov=src .
$ ls htmlcov
# open htmlcov/index.html in your favourite browser
~~~~

## Debugging

Use of the Django Debug Toolbar is strongly recommended, but it does have a known limitation which prevents usage during normal operation due to the use of pandas within asxtrade: see <https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar/issues/1053> for details. For this reason, the MIDDLEWARE setting for
the toolbar is commented out, except when needed.
