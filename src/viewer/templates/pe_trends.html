    This visualisation shows the average PE per sector over the timeframe. Can be used to identify expensive (or cheap) sectors within the market as a whole. Average PE 
    is approximately 15 in the long run. Higher PE indicates an expensive market, all other things being equal. For more information: <a href="https://www.commsec.com.au/education/learn/choosing-investments/what-is-price-to-earnings-pe-ratio.html">CommSec</a>

    <ul>
        <li>Only {{ n_stocks }} stocks were considered over the timeframe</li>
        <li>Stocks with zero (or negative) average PE are ignored - this resulted in only {{ n_stocks_with_pe }} stocks remaining</li>
        <li>Timeframe: {{ timeframe.description }}</li>
        <li>The <i>Not Applic</i> category often contains ETFs so as a basket of stocks, can be misleading as far as EPS and P/E are concerned</li>
        <li>Stocks participating in a given sector can be found via <a href="{% url 'sector-search' %}">Find By Sector</a></li>
